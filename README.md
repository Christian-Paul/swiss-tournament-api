# swiss-tournament-api
This project is an api for managing a swiss style tournament. 

## Swiss Style Tournaments
In a swiss style tournament, players aren't eliminated; they're matched up against players with similar win rates, and in the end, the player with the best win rate is the champion.

# Usage
To initialize the database, run `psql` then run `\i tournament.sql`. To run the tests, run `python tournament_test.py`
